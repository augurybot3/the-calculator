<!--There is no one-size-fits all answer to this question, as the implementation will vary depending on the specific
requirements of the project. However, some tips on using flexbox with JavaScript to create a grid layout include:

1.Use the flexbox model to define the overall structure of the grid.

2.Use CSS media queries to specify the number of columns and breakpoints for different screen sizes

3.Use JavaScript to dynamically generate the HTML for each grid item.

4.Use CSS to style the grid items, including setting the width, height, and margins.-->

/* 1.Use JavaScript to dynamically generate the HTML for each grid item */


// 3. Use Javascript to dynamically create the HTML elements
// or in this case, the grid.

//WHAT I KNOW AS OF NOW: The goal of this first part of the javascript
// is to dynamically create HTML elements that will be the grid.
// I know that I need to create a function that will create the grid
// and then call that function in the HTML file.
// I also know that I need to create a variable that will be the
// number of either rows or columns or possibly both that will be
// created in the grid. I am considering two hypothetical scenarios.

//HYPOTHESIS 1: We only need one 'for (loop){action}' because we do not need
// to differentiate between rows and columns. We can just create
// a grid with the same number of rows and columns, creating <div>'s.
// because the grid is a square, we can just use one variable
// as well as the fact that the <div>'s are going to be brought into
// rows and columns by the CSS display: grid property and the 
// grid-template-columns: repeat(x, y) property.

<a script src=

// (possible drawbacks to this solution: Screen sizes vary in density and size and 
// therefore the grid may be too large on mobile devices or older monitors.
// this is because, while the grid has the potential to be flexible, i am relying on
// the explicit overflow of the columns to create the rows and therefore will not
// be able to have a dynamically sized container/ grid -more that likely. 
// there's a chance i may be able to create a limit on the size or possibly 
// even find a way to receive the info for the screen size and plug that in as 
// variable but that may be taking things a bit too far....)

// HYPOTHESIS 2: A for loop within a for loop will create a grid.
// By passing the value of i into the inner for loop, we can create
// a grid with the same number of rows and columns.
// The inner for loop will create the columns, and the outer loop
// will create the rows. The CSS will be for pure styling purposes
// and to apply filters or colors to the grid.

// ( i don't know how to do this just yet. I am attempting to avoid
// some of the other tools that people have been submitting with 
// their projects because, if I am able to accomplish this without 
// using a pre-made grid library or using jquery, since we haven't 
// been introduced to that yet.... i think the purpose of this project
// is to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the fundamentals - as
// that is the name of the section in this course after all. wish me luck....)
